## Data structure & Algorithms

This is my study repo, here I'll implement some of the most commom algorithms and data structures and try to improve the performance for them. You'll find some leetcode too, the leetcode files will be named with the number of the exercise like "5.ts". Most of the comments in code will be in portuguese and all files are in Typescript.

If you find a better way to implement something, please let me know, you can open a discussion or call me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieloschagas/), I'm always open to new knowledge ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜—ðŸ¤˜

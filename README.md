## Data structure & Algorithms

This is my study repo, here I'll implement some of the most commom algorithms and data structures and try to improve the performance for them. You'll find some leetcode too, the leetcode files will be named with the number of the exercise like "5.ts". Most of the comments in code will be in portuguese.

## How to run

```console
npm install
npx tsx <path to file>
```
